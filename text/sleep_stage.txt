There are two basic types of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (which can be further subdivided into three different stages: N1, N2 and N3). Each is linked to specific brain waves and neuronal activity. You cycle through all stages of non-REM and REM sleep several times during a typical night, with increasingly longer, deeper REM periods occurring toward morning.

<b>N1 sleep</b> corresponds to the transitional period between wakefulness and sleep. During this short period of relatively light sleep, your brain waves, heartbeat, breathing, and eye movements slow, and your muscles relax. A high percentage of N1 sleep is generally a result of fragmented sleep caused by sleep disorders, snoring, or environmental disturbances.

<b>N2 sleep</b> is the most abundant sleep stage with ~50% of the total sleep time. During N2 sleep, your heartbeat and breathing slow, and muscles relax even further. Your body temperature drops and eye movements stop. Brain wave activity slows but is marked by brief bursts of electrical activity, which are linked to memory consolidation. A low percentage of N2 sleep may be a result of sleep fragmentation, increased REM sleep or N3 sleep, or a result of obstructive sleep apnea-related arousals.

<b>N3 sleep</b> is considered as "deep" sleep and is sometimes referred to as slow wave sleep. N3 sleep primarily occurs during the first half of the night. Your heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels during sleep. Your muscles are relaxed and it may be difficult to awaken you. Brain waves become even slower and larger, which denotes synchronization between populations of neurons. A high amount of N3 sleep is typical after sleep deprivation. Reduced N3 sleep is noted as a side effect of certain medications, including benzo-diazepines, TCAs, and barbiturates. Episodes of night terror sleep walking, sleep talking, and confusion arousals also occur during N3 sleep.

<b>REM sleep</b> cycles occur every 90 to 120 min throughout the night with progressively increasing periods of time. Your eyes move rapidly from side to side behind closed eyelids. Brain activity becomes closer to that seen in wakefulness. Your breathing becomes faster and irregular, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels. Most of your dreaming occurs during REM sleep, although some can also occur in non-REM sleep. Your arm and leg muscles become temporarily paralyzed, which prevents you from acting out your dreams. REM sleep is also associated with more frequent and longer duration apneas. Certain sleep disorders, including sleep apnea, REM behavior sleep disorder, and nightmares occur in REM sleep. A higher amount of REM sleep is notable after discontinuation of REM sleep suppressing medications, alcohol, cannabis, and initiation of CPAP therapy.
