There are two basic types of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep (which can be further subdivided into three different stages: N1, N2 and N3). Each is linked to specific brain waves and neuronal activity. You cycle through all stages of non-REM and REM sleep several times during a typical night, with increasingly longer REM periods occurring toward morning.

<b>N1 sleep</b> is the transitional period between wakefulness and sleep. During this short period of relatively light sleep, your brain waves, heartbeat, breathing, and eye movements slow, and your muscles relax. A high percentage of N1 sleep is generally a result of fragmented sleep caused by sleep disorders, snoring, or environmental disturbances.

<b>N2 sleep</b> is the most abundant sleep stage with ~50% of the total sleep time. During N2 sleep, your heartbeat and breathing slow, and muscles relax even further. Your body temperature drops and eye movements stop. Brain wave activity slows but is marked by brief bursts of electrical activity, which are linked to memory consolidation. A low percentage of N2 sleep may be a result of sleep fragmentation, increased REM sleep or N3 sleep, or a result of obstructive sleep apnea-related arousals.

<b>N3 sleep</b> is the "deeper" stage of sleep and is sometimes called slow wave sleep. N3 sleep primarily occurs during the first half of the night. Your heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels during sleep. Your muscles are relaxed and it may be difficult to awaken you. Brain waves become even slower and larger, which denotes synchronization between large populations of neurons. Higher levels of N3 sleep are thought to be restorative and may occur in response to sleep deprivation and/or intense levels of mental or physical activity over the prior day. Perturbations in N3 sleep have been linked to diabetes and hypertension, and can occur as a side effect of certain medications, including benzodiazepines, TCAs, and barbiturates. Episodes of night terror sleep walking, sleep talking, and confusion arousals also occur during N3 sleep.

<b>REM sleep</b>, which is sometimes referred as paradoxical sleep, occurs every 90 to 120 min throughout the night with progressively increasing duration. During REM sleep, your eyes move rapidly and brain activity becomes closer to that seen in wakefulness. Your breathing becomes faster and irregular, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase to near waking levels. Most of your dreaming occurs during REM sleep, although some can also occur in non-REM sleep. Your arm and leg muscles become temporarily paralyzed, which prevents you from acting out your dreams. REM sleep is especially important for mood and memory, and is critical for the developing brain. Certain sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea, REM behavior sleep disorder, and nightmares primarily occur in REM sleep. A higher amount of REM sleep is notable after discontinuation of REM sleep suppressing medications, alcohol, cannabis, and initiation of CPAP therapy.
